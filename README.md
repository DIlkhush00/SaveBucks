## About The Project

SaveBucks is a smart price comparison tool that helps users find the best deals online. You can search for any product, and it scrapes real-time data to show you the most affordable options out there.

Oh, and one of the main reasons I built this was to get my hands on web scraping and try out different tech tools. ðŸ‘€
